Written Description of three observable trends based on the data:

Latitude vs Temperature scatter plot shows that the coorelative relationship between city latitude and city's max temperature. It consists of a curved shape line and it means the cities located around the equator has higher max temperature than cities far from the equater.
Latitude vs Humidity scatter plot is analyzing the coorelative relationship between city latitude and city's humidity percentage.It relatively shows that cities located in nothern atmosphere has a little bit higher humidity.
Latitude vs. Cloudiness and Wind Speed scatter illustrates the coorelative relationship between city latitude and city's cloudiness percentage.This polt doesn't really show a strong correlation between these two factors.
Northern Hemisphere and Southern Hemisphere Max temp vs. Latitude Linear Regression both show that the higher the latitude the lower the temperature.
Northern Hemisphere and Southern Hemisphere Humidity vs. Latitude Linear Regression shows that there is a slight positive relationship between humidity and latitude.The higher latitude the higher humudity level.
Northern Hemisphere and Southern Hemisphere Cloudiness vs. Latitude Linear Regression and Northern Hemisphere and Southern Hemisphere Wind Speed vs. Latitude Linear Regression doesn't really show any strong relationships as well.
